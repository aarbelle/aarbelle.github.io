First of all, I am a husband and father of three amazing girls. 
I am currently a Senior Research Scientist and Manager of the AI-Vision group at IBM Research. 
My recent areas of interest are mainly the intersection of Computer Vision and Lanuage models. I am also interesed in general Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 
At IBM research we focus on AI for business and we implement methods and tools to accelerate business use-cases through computer vision and AI. As part of our research we have published multiple papers in top venues and aim to make our research open to the community. 

I recieved my PhD from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in 2020, under the supervision of Dr. Tammy Riklin Raviv. During that time I studied and developed methods for high throughput microscopy video analysis including single cell segmentation and tracking. 

My personal hobbies include climbing, sky diving, scuba diving, karate, and many many more....
