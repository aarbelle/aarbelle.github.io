First of all, I am a husband and father of three amazing girls. 
I am currently a Senior Research Scientist and Manager of the Multimodal-AI group at IBM Research. My group includes 13 Research Scientists with experience in a wide range of fields such as Computer Vision, Speech and Audio, Natural Language Processing, Physics, and others. The team is currently focused on Multimodal Foundation Models - working on the next generation of models for multiple tasks across modalities. 
My recent areas of interest are mainly the intersection of Computer Vision and Lanuage models. I am also interesed in general Computer Vision and Machine Learning, Speech and Audio, and more. 
At IBM research we focus on AI for business and we implement methods and tools to accelerate business use-cases through computer vision and AI. As part of our research we have published multiple papers in top venues and aim to make our research open to the community. 

I recieved my PhD from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in 2020, under the supervision of Dr. Tammy Riklin Raviv. During that time I studied and developed methods for high throughput microscopy video analysis including single cell segmentation and tracking. 

My personal hobbies include climbing, sky diving, scuba diving, karate, and many many more....
